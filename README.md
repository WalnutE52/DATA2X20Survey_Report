# DATA2X20Survey_Report

## Research Question

### 1. Is this a random sample of DATA2X02 students?

### 2. What are the potential biases? Which variables are most likely to be subjected to this
bias?

### 3. Which questions needed improvement to generate useful data (e.g. in terms of the
way the question was phrased or response validation)?

### 4. Does the number of COVID tests a student has taken in the past two months follow a
Poisson distribution?

### 5.5. Identify three additional questions you can answer from the data and perform a
hypothesis test for each question. The hypotheses should be of the same form as what
we have covered in lectures.
a. Give a motivation for why you selected these questions.
b. Be sure to report the and interpret the results.
c. Be sure to mention any limitations in the data that may impact your findings.
d. There needs to be some variety in the types of tests you implement, at least
one test from module 1 and at least one test from module 2.
